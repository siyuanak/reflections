Question: Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is mainly for version control of proejcts. For big project, it is easy to break into pieces.
Google Doss is cheifly for documents. Each document may have indenpendent content. 


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

1. Commit the current workfiles before make changes.
2. Start to make changes and see what happens.
3. If something work not properly, the revert to the previous commit.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I would like to using Git to do version control for me.
